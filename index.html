        HTML is the World Wide Web's core markup language. Originally,
         HTML was primarily designed as a language for semantically describing scientific documents. 
         Its general design, however, has enabled it to be adapted, over the subsequent years, to describe a number of other types of documents and even applications.
         The scope of this specification is not to describe an entire operating system.
<br><br>

          In particular, hardware configuration software, image manipulation tools, and applications that users would be expected to use with high-end workstations on a daily basis are out of scope. 
          In terms of applications, this specification is targeted specifically at applications that would be expected to be used by users on an occasional basis, or regularly but from disparate locations, with low CPU requirements. 
          Examples of such applications include online purchasing systems, searching systems, games (especially multiplayer online games), public telephone books or address books, communications software (email clients, instant messaging clients, discussion software), document editing software, etc.

          HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, which can be a confusing term for many beginners. The best way to explain HTML is to examine the meaning of each word.
HyperText refers to text that contains links to other texts. Every time you click on a highlighted or underlined link that takes you to another page, you are using hypertext. As more and more pages use hypertext to link to each other, a “web” of pages starts to form. This is where we get the term World Wide Web.
Markup refers to the special symbols or codes that are inserted into a document to tell the web browser how to display the document data. For example, markup code may tell the browser to display a phrase in bold or italic text, or may tell the browser which parts of the document are headings and which are paragraphs. HTML is just one of a number of languages that uses markup code.

Language refers to the idea that the code is standardized. Just like regular spoken languages, there are certain rules that everyone must follow when writing HTML. 
This is so that all browsers can understand and interpret the code. 
There are many different programming languages, and you may have heard of some of the popular ones such as Java, Python and Ruby. 
Each language has its own unique set of rules, and many languages can be used in combination with HTML to create amazing webpages and applications.
<br><br>
With a basic knowledge of HTML (as well as a little CSS), you can build a truly unique website that you can edit and update yourself, and you won’t have to pay expensive monthly service fees.
Learning HTML is also considered the first step for progressing into more complex and in-demand programming languages.
Fancy earning a six-figure salary as a web developer for a Silicon Valley startup? Or maybe you’ve got plans to develop the next Facebook or Twitter? If you’re interested in learning how to do any web related programming, HTML is the place to start.
